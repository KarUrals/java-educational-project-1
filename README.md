# Brain Games

This project is a set of five console games:

1. **Even** game - *Definition of an even number*
2. **Calc** game - *Arithmetic expressions to be evaluated*
3. **GCD** game - *Finding the Greatest Common Divisor*
4. **Progression** game - *Search for missing number in a sequence of numbers*
5. **Prime** game - *Definition of a prime number*

Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered to be completed. Wrong answers end the game.
